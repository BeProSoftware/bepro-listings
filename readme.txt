= Easy Setup (Just one and done) =

1. Put this shortcode [bl_all_in_one] in any page or post. 
2. Confirm "Ajax Page" is selected on the BePro Listings admin page, for the option "how links open". 

Thats it, everything works on one page (**google maps**, listings, categories, search, etc). When you are ready for *custom configurations*, we have a plethora of extra shortcodes and options. If you prefer an alternative to the DIY method, check out our **$1 one dollar wordpress themes** and **available support** on our website.

Remember, unlike other solutions, just about everything in BePro Listings can be set to an **off state** i.e. removed. So, if your solution does not need **Google Maps**, ajax, or cost related info, then simply turn off the options in the admin. Then use the shortcodes that do focus on your needs.

= Popular Uses =

BePro Listings can be applied to any listings scenario. It's designed to be modular and flexible, facilitating custom combinations, as you integrate it into your current theme. Configure options like, # of uploads, **ajax search filter**, default search distance, and item page details. With our buddypress option, you can allow your members to control their own submissions (add/edit/delete). Look at some of the ways people are using the plugin:

= THEMES =

BePro Listings has spawned the famous **$1 one dollar wordpress themes**. The plugin has so many options, that we felt a practical tutorial would be the best introduction. The goal of our $1 wordpress themes, is to showcase BePro Listings features; However, they posses all of the features of any other theme. Some of our $1 one dollar wordpress themes are **complete themes**, while others are **child themes** built on free solutions. We want to prove that you can integrate BePro Listings into any theme and create any type of listings site. **CHALLENGE US!** 

	1. ByCater - This responsive directory theme features a home page template utilizing (google map, search, categories, and listings). It also integrates with typical wordpress features like, sidebar, menu, etc
	2. FolioProjects - Responsive Child theme for the stock wordpress twentyfourteen teamplate. Perfect for gallery, portfolio, and other sites where you want to emphasize the featured images. Comes with three templates
	3. MT Classifieds - Great responsive theme for classified focused websites. Template uses various features including (google map, categories, and listings)
	4. WhatLocalsCallIt - Great responsive directory theme built on the twentytwelve foundation. Great option for a Product catalogue

= WHATS THE DIFFERENCE? =

We created BePro Listings and its addons to be *modular*. This allows you to only add the features you need, effectively speeding up the *load time* of your website. The prices of our Addons start at $5 and our themes are $1. You can also buy *bundles* of plugins and themes for great discounts. Effectively, we are offering you, the freedom to interchange options, at a very *cost effective* rate.

Out of the box, BePro Listings works with buddypress and many **gallery plugins** (e.g. galleria). Via addons, we also integrate with s2member, paid membership pro, and several other popular plugins. This makes it extreamly easy and quick to add the best combinations of features for extending your **directory** / **classifieds** / **portfolio** / **Catalogue** site. 

Most importantly, BePro Listings is built for various levels of users. Novice users will appreciate our $1 themes, **ajax features** and *"all in one"* shortcodes. Intermediate users will appreiate the plethora of, configuration options, widgets and extra shortcodes. Also we didn't forget developers and advanced users with our long list of wordpress hooks and filters.

= SHORTCODES =
These all have options and you can check them out via the documentation link above.

	* Dynamic Map - Setup a map anywhere showing the last listings on your site e.g. [generate_map]
	* Basic Search - Allow users to search listings e.g. [search_form]
	* Filter Search - Allow users to do a more in depth search including, cost, date, etc e.g. [filter_form]
	* Listings - Show listings with optional paging e.g. [display_listings]

	* All In One (NEW) - Use one shortcode to implement several features at once. Various configurations available [bl_all_in_one].

= TROUBLE SHOOTING =

* 404 Error - If Listing pages produce a 404 error, try resetting your permalink settings in the admin. Simply re-save your current settings, so that they are reset for all urls. The option is under your settings menu.

* Google Maps - If google map controls look weird, this is a css style related issue (your theme). Specifically, its the addition of max-width declarations to images. For details, you can *google* the issue (**google maps** max-width). Lots of bootstrap themes use this css declaration.
